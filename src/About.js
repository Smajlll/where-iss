            <p>Hey, I'm Smajl, and I made this site. This site is made in React, uses <a href="https://wheretheiss.at/"> this</a> API to fetch the current position of the ISS, it also uses leaflet for the map embed.</p>
            <p>The site is made for HackClub Arcade, which is a "challenge" for the summer to make some applications, websites etc.</p>
            <p>Hope you like it! üòâ</p>
